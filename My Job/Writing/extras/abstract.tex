In recent years, a positive trend of total water storage is detected in many big basins. One of them is Ob river basin in west Siberia. In this thesis, measurements from GRACE and GRACE-FO mission are employed and analyzed to determine the total water storage change in this region. Meanwhile, precipitation and evapotranspiration from global datasets and runoff determined using satellite altimetry will also be taken into discussion. Finally, those questions will be answered: how did the total water storage change from January of 2003 to December of 2019? In which period did these changes happen and what are the reasons behind them?
